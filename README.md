FMStudio
===
Graphical frontend for use with the [Fluent Migrator](https://github.com/schambers/fluentmigrator/) library.


This is a fork of the awesome original project found at: https://github.com/infosupport/FMStudio

# Changes

## 1. Added Postgres
This version has added support for Postgres by adding the Postgres target to the UI and wiring it up to the FluentMigrator Postgres package

## 2. Updated all libs to the latest
There were some out of date packages that made building on the latest .net a little more challenging. These were updated and some slight method signatures were changed.
